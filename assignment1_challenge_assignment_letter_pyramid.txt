Section 10: Assignment 1 - Challenge Assignment - Letter Pyramid
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements and Explanation:

	Write a C++ program that displays a Letter Pyramid from a user-provided std::string.
	Prompt the user to enter a std::string and then from that string display a Letter
	Pyramid as follows:

	It's much easier to understand the Letter Pyramid given examples.
	If the user enters the string "ABC", then your program should display:

			A
		       ABA
		      ABCBA

	If the user enters the string, "12345", then your program should display:

			1
		       121
		      12321
		     1234321
		    123454321

	If the user enters 'ABCDEFG', then your program should display:

			A
		       ABA
		      ABCBA
		     ABCDCBA
		    ABCDEDCBA
	           ABCDEFEDCBA
	          ABCDEFGFEDCBA

	If the user enters 'C++isFun!", then your program should display:

			C
		       C+C
		      C+++C
		     C++i++C
		    C++isi++C
		   C++isFsi++C
		  C++isFuFsi++C
		 C++isFunuFsi++C
		C++isFun!nuFsi++C

	Think about the problem before you begin and break it down into steps.

	This can be a very challenging problem to solve!

	Have fun!
